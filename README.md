# 🐶 Dog Breed Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes deep learning to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub, the model is trained to recognize and categorize different dog breeds accurately.

## 📂 Dataset
You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs.
